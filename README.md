# SciPy-Tutorial
Mathematics deals with a huge number of concepts that are very important but at the same time, complex and time-consuming.
However, Python provides the full-fledged SciPy library that resolves this issue for us. 
In this SciPy tutorial, you will be learning how to make use of this library along with a few functions and their examples.

So let’s get started. :)

SciPy — Python Library

SciPy is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the NumPy extension of Python. It adds significant power to the interactive Python session by providing the user with high-level commands and classes for manipulating and visualizing data. With SciPy, an interactive Python session becomes a data-processing and system-prototyping environment rivaling systems, such as MATLAB, IDL, Octave, R-Lab, and SciLab.
